            <h1>Obsessive-Compulsive Dissorder</h1>
            <p>Through greater awareness and education, we can envision a future where individuals with mental illnesses
                are respected
                and supported. Mental health impacts everyone. According to Health Canada, approximately 20% of
                individuals will
                experience a mental illness during their lifetime, while the remaining 80% are likely to be affected
                indirectly through
                family or friends.<br />Despite progress in understanding mental health, stigma and fear around mental
                illnesses remain. Social exclusion
                continues to be a significant barrier for many individuals with mental health conditions. A healthy
                society is one where
                acceptance and understanding replace ignorance and fear, fostering an environment of respect and
                support.</p>

            <h2>What is OCD?</h2>
            <div class="intro-wrapper">
            <p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition defined by persistent obsessions and
                compulsions that
                cause significant distress.<strong>Obsessions</strong> are intrusive, unwanted thoughts, images, or
                urges that trigger anxiety. For
                example, someone might constantly fear contaminating others with germs. These thoughts are not
                reflective of personal
                character but are symptoms of the disorder.<br />
                <strong>Compulsions</strong> are repetitive actions or mental rituals performed to reduce the anxiety
                caused by obsessions. Examples
                include excessive cleaning, counting, or checking things repeatedly. While individuals with OCD often
                recognize their
                behaviors as irrational, they struggle to control them. OCD symptoms can evolve over time, making
                understanding and
                support crucial.

        <section id="what-causes-ocd">
            <h2>What Causes OCD?</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of OCD remains unclear, but it is believed to result from a combination of genetic,
                neurological,
                environmental, and psychological factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Family history plays a role, as individuals with relatives who have OCD
                    may be at
                    higher risk.</li>
                <li><strong>Brain Function:</strong> Abnormalities in regions associated with decision-making and
                    emotional
                    regulation have been linked to OCD.</li>
                <li><strong>Life Events:</strong> Stressful life events or trauma can trigger or exacerbate symptoms in
                    predisposed individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Chemical Imbalances:</strong> Research suggests that an imbalance in serotonin, a
                    neurotransmitter
                    regulating mood and behavior, may contribute.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding these factors is vital for early intervention and effective treatment.</p>

        <section id="prevalence-of-ocd">
            <h2>Prevalence of OCD</h2>
            <div class="prevalence-wrapper">
            <img src="./ocd-brain.webp" alt="brain" class="brain">
            <p>OCD is the fourth most common mental health condition, affecting 2-3% of the population during their
                lifetime. This
                prevalence translates to millions globally. Certain groups, such as new parents, may experience higher
                rates due to
                unique stressors.<br />Unfortunately, OCD is frequently misdiagnosed or overlooked, often mistaken for
                other conditions like anxiety or
                depression. This lack of awareness perpetuates stigma and delays access to proper care. Raising public
                understanding of
                OCD can help combat these issues, ensuring timely support and reducing misconceptions.</p></div>

            <h2>Signs and Symptoms of OCD</h2>
            <p>OCD manifests in various ways, often combining visible compulsions with invisible obsessions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Common signs:</strong>Excessive handwashing, checking behaviors, or arranging items
                    symmetrically.</li>
                <li><strong>Intrusive Thoughts:</strong>Thoughts about harm, guilt, or taboo subjects, leading to
                    internal mental rituals like silent counting or praying.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These hidden struggles often go unrecognized, even by healthcare professionals, underscoring the
                importance of awareness
                and specialized training.</p>

                    <p>OCD is not simply a preoccupation with cleanliness. Symptoms like symmetry obsessions or fears of
                        contamination disrupt daily life. Obsessions can also involve taboo topics like sex, violence,
                        or religion.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Myth #2:</strong> OCD is a minor quirk or preference.
                    <p>OCD is a serious condition, not a personality quirk. It stems from trauma, stress, and brain

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Myth #4:</strong> OCD is rare.

                <li>
                    <strong>Myth #5:</strong> Everyone has a little OCD.
                    <p>Phrases like "I’m a little OCD" trivialize the condition, which significantly disrupts lives.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Myth #6:</strong> OCD is Just a Phase.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Myth #7:</strong> OCD is Due to Weak Willpower.
                    <p>Treatment involves professional help, not just willpower.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Myth #8:</strong> OCD is Untreatable

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Myth #9:</strong> Avoiding Triggers Cures OCD
                    <p>Avoidance worsens OCD over time, reinforcing fears.</p>

                <li>
                    <strong>Myth #10:</strong> OCD is the Same for Everyone.
